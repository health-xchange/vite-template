Arbitration Agreement &amp; Dispute Resolution Please read this Arbitration
Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with Health X Change, Inc. and
affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND
A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.<br>
Scope of Arbitration Agreement (“Arbitration Agreement”). You acknowledge and
agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of
the Services or to any other aspect of your relationship with Health X Change,
Inc. will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that
(1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify, so long
as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual
(non-class, non-representative) basis; and (2) you or Health X Change, Inc. may
seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual
property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets,
copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without
limitation, to all claims that arose before this or any prior agreement. NOW OR
IN THE FUTURE, THERE MAY BE LAWSUITS AGAINST Health X Change, Inc. ALLEGING
CLASS, COLLECTIVE, AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS. SUCH CLAIMS, IF SUCCESSFUL,
COULD RESULT IN SOME MONETARY RECOVERY TO YOU. THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH CLASS,
COLLECTIVE, AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE LAWSUITS DOES NOT MEAN THAT SUCH LAWSUITS
WILL ULTIMATELY SUCCEED. BUT IF YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATION WITH HEALTH X CHANGE,
INC., YOU ARE AGREEING IN ADVANCE THAT YOU WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN OR SEEK TO
RECOVERY MONETARY OR OTHER RELIEF UNDER SUCH CLASS, COLLECTIVE, AND/OR
REPRESENTATIVE LAWSUITS. INSTEAD, BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU MAY BRING
YOUR CLAIMS AGAINST HEALTH X CHANGE, INC. IN AN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION
PROCEEDING. IF SUCCESSFUL ON SUCH CLAIMS, YOU COULD BE AWARDED MONEY OR OTHER
RELIEF BY AN ARBITRATOR.<br>
Arbitration Rules and Forum. This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the
Federal Arbitration Act in all respects. To begin an arbitration proceeding,
you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim in an
email to&nbsp;</span><span style="color:black;mso-color-alt:windowtext"><a href="mailto:admin@health-x-change.com" target="_self"><span style="font-size:

&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:#525F7F;mso-font-kerning:0pt;mso-ligatures:none">. The

under the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules. The AAA’s rules are available

by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration,
and arbitration fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules. We will reimburse
those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator
determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, Health X Change, Inc. will not
seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines
the claims are frivolous. If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties
will select an alternative arbitral forum. Arbitrator Powers. The arbitrator,
and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive
authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability,
enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not
limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void
or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of
you and Health X Change, <span class="GramE">Inc..</span> The dispute will not be
consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.
The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or
part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award
monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an
individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and these Terms of
Use. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision
describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based,
including the calculation of any damages awarded.<br>
The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis
that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final
and binding on you and Health X Change, Inc..<br>
Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND HEALTH X CHANGE, INC. EACH KNOWINGLY AND
VOLUNTARILY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND
RECEIVE A JUDGE OR JURY TRIAL. You and Health X Change, Inc. are instead
electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. An arbitrator can
award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must
follow these Terms of Use as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury
in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. In any
litigation between you and Health X Change, Inc. over whether to vacate or
enforce an arbitration award, you and Health X Change, Inc. waive all rights to
a jury trial, and elect instead to have a judge resolve the dispute.<br>
Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE
SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS
AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE
ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER
CUSTOMER OR USER. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is
deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Health X Change, Inc. is
entitled to arbitration. Instead, all claims and disputes will then be resolved
in a court as set forth in this document (Disputes, Governing Law, Venue and
Jurisdiction) above.<br>
<span class="SpellE">Opt</span> Out. You may opt out of this Arbitration
Agreement. If you do so, neither you nor Health X Change, Inc. can force the
other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify Health X Change, Inc. in
writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration
Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your Health X
Change, Inc. username (if any), the email address you used to set up your
Health X Change, Inc. account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement
that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. You must send <span class="GramE">your</span> opt-out notice to:&nbsp;</span><span style="color:black;

Use will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has
no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may

Use to initiate litigation in a court, both you and Health X Change, Inc. agree
that all claims and disputes HEALTH X CHANGE, INC. TERMS OF USE arising out of
